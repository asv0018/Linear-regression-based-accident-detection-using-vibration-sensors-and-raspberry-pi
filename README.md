# Linear-regression-based-accident-detection-using-vibration-sensors-and-raspberry-pi

In this project, we have developed the accident detection technique using the data obtained by the vibration sensor. The algorithm used to detect the accident/non-accident status, is linear regression. When there is an accident, the system sends out the message alert to the family via sms and images of the accident through telegram app. It also sends the alerts to the family if the person is drunk.
